When building the project, use

bun install

Then, change directories to double-ecdsa, and run

bun link

Then, when you create a test project that uses the dependency, run the command that `bun link` returns

bun link @zerodev/double-ecdsa-validator

When ready for production, contact ZeroDev

the goal is to just use it for Giza, with no external usage
